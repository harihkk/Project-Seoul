// Project Seoul runtime composition.
//
// STATE OWNERSHIP (product-wide state rules):
//   owner:        one SeoulRuntime per regular profile, owned by the
//                 profile-keyed SeoulRuntimeService.
//   lifetime:     the profile.
//   persistence:  per-profile ephemeral for the live registries; durable
//                 product state (scenes, workflows, organization) lives in its
//                 own stores and is referenced by id, not duplicated here.
//   recovery:     registries are rebuilt on construction; connectors re-import
//                 their capabilities on connect.
//   teardown:     Shutdown() disconnects connectors (removing their
//                 capabilities) and drops the registries in a defined order.
//   bounds:       registries are individually bounded (see their limits).
//   isolation:    per profile; never process-global.
//
// This is the single composition point that gives every product subsystem a
// production owner: the capability graph, the connector registry (which mirrors
// connector tools into the capability graph), the scene registry, and the
// reasoning-router policy. The task executor, the Canvas, and the shell reach
// these through the runtime rather than through free globals.
