# Host-side C++ syntax gate for Seoul-owned source. Parses every given .cc (or
# a default set of protocol-critical files) with Apple clang against the REAL
# pinned checkout headers (-fsyntax-only; no build, no gn). Generated buildflag
# headers do not exist without `gn gen`, so they are stubbed on the fly and
# every BUILDFLAG_INTERNAL_* the parse encounters is defined to 0 - a
# conservative, no-op configuration. This is NOT compilation and proves no
# codegen or linking; it catches include, name, type, and template errors in
# Seoul code a plain read cannot, on hosts the build gate refuses.
